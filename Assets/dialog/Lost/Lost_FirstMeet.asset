  - speaker: The lost
    content: Heeey there... How's today going?
  - speaker: 
    content: "The man greeting you has a sleepy look, propped against a nearby stone
      column and casually blocking your path\u2014simply with his long legs."
  - speaker: The lost
    content: Hah, bad question. Today might have just begun, right? Living here...
      it makes me dizzy.
  - speaker: 
    content: His eyes roll...... and fix on you.
  - speaker: The lost
    content: But seems like a long one already for you.
  - speaker: You
    content: I'm fine.
  - speaker: The lost
    content: "Ohhh, don\u2019t be so cold. You wanna pass? Well, of course you wouldn\u2019t
      ask me to go back into that cave behind me, not in times like these. I\u2019d

  - speaker: You
    content: Perhaps you could move your legs.
  - speaker: The lost
    content: Aaaaaall right...
  - speaker: 
    content: He unfolded himself from his lean against the stone column and turned
      to face you.
  - speaker: The Lost
    content: I am one of the Four Heavenly Kings. You know the rules.
  - speaker: You
    content: Of course. The duel.
